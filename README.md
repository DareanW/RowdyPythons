# RowdyPythons
 A game of Snake programmed in Python for RowdyHacks

We brainstormed and gathered around our computers so we all collaborated as a group.

The game code is game.py
To run, open Command Prompt on Windows. You may need to run the command `pip install pygame`. Now, place game.py in your current directory and run `python3 game.py`.
